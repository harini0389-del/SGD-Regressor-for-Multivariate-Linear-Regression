# SGD-Regressor-for-Multivariate-Linear-Regression

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the price of the house and number of occupants in the house with SGD regressor.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1.1. Import Required Libraries
2. Load and Inspect the Dataset
3. Select Multiple Input Features and Target Variable
4. Split the Dataset into Training and Testing Sets
5. Perform Feature Scaling on Input Variables
6. Initialize and Configure the SGD Regressor Model
7. Train the Model Using Training Data
8. Predict Output for Test Data
9. Evaluate Model Performance Using Error Metrics
